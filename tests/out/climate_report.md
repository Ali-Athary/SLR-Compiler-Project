**Abstract:** The most recent concern of all people on Earth is the increase in the
concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The concentration of these
gases has risen rapidly over the last century and if the trend continues it can
cause many adverse climatic changes. There have been ways implemented to curb
this by the government by limiting processes that emit a higher amount of CO2,
one such greenhouse gas. However, there is mounting evidence that the CO2
numbers supplied by the government do not accurately reflect the performance of
automobiles on the road. Our proposal of using artificial intelligence
techniques to improve a previously rudimentary process takes a radical tack,
but it fits the bill given the situation. To determine which algorithms and
models produce the greatest outcomes, we compared them all and explored a novel
method of ensembling them. Further, this can be used to foretell the rise in
global temperature and to ground crucial policy decisions like the adoption of
electric vehicles. To estimate emissions from vehicles, we used machine
learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning on a massive dataset.

**Title:** A 100% Renewable Energy System: Enabling Zero CO2 Emission Offshore
  Platforms

**Abstract:** The total electricity consumption from offshore oil/gas platforms is around
16 TWh worldwide in 2019. The majority offshore platforms are powered by the
diesel generators while the rest mainly uses gas turbines, which emits large
amounts of CO2 per year. The fast development of offshore wind turbines (WT)
can potentially replace traditional fossil fuel based resources to power
offshore loads. Thus, a novel offshore hybrid renewable energy sources (OHRES)
system is proposed to enable a zero CO2 emission offshore platform mitigating
climate change. Battery energy storage system (BESS) and hydrogen energy
storage system (HESS) are considered to mitigate the fluctuation of wind power
in the proposed OHRES system. Resilience models are designed to enhance the
resilience of the proposed OHRES system with extra energy stored in BESS and/or
HESS. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed OHRES system to
power offshore platforms. The economic analysis reports the planning cost for
the proposed OHRES system under different resilience levels, which may benefit
the decision to balance the carbon emission and investment cost.
