**Abstract:** Beam management (BM) protocols are critical for establishing and maintaining
connectivity between network radio nodes and User Equipments (UEs). In
Distributed Multiple Input Multiple Output systems (D-MIMO), a number of access
points (APs), coordinated by a central processing unit (CPU), serves a number
of UEs. At mmWave frequencies, the problem of finding the best AP and beam to
serve the UEs is challenging due to a large number of beams that need to be
sounded with Downlink (DL) reference signals. The objective of this paper is to
investigate whether the best AP/beam can be reliably inferred from sounding
only a small subset of beams and leveraging AI/ML for inference of best
beam/AP. We use Random Forest (RF), MissForest (MF) and conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (c-GAN) for demonstrating the performance benefits of
inference.

## Paper 2
**Title:** A Quick Primer on Machine Learning in Wireless Communications
**Authors:** Faris B. Mismar
**Published:** 2023-12-29T18:04:11Z
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17713v4
**Abstract:** This is our third (and final) issue of the quick primer on the use of Python
to build a wireless communications prototype. This prototype simulates
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems for a single orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol. In addition, it shows several
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) use cases with code
implementation. The intent of this primer is to empower the reader with the
means to efficiently create reproducible simulations related to AI and ML in
wireless communications. This primer has sprung from a draft aligned with the
syllabus of a graduate course (EESC 7v86), which we created to be first taught
in Fall 2022.
